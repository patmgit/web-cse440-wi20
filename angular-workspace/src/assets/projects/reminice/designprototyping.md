### Problem and Solution Overview
Our design aims to help people easily record their daily lives to actively facilitate effective and enjoyable reminiscing. To explore this, we conducted a survey and series of interviews to understand how people go through tasks involving journaling and  reminiscing. Some themes we found were that people use a variety of mediums to journal and that each individual has unique patterns of how they go about cataloging their memories. Further, many individuals saw journaling as a daunting task but wanted other ways to document memories they could look back on.

We identified six tasks related to recording memories so they be retained for the purpose of reminiscing: **(1)** going back through old media to reminisce, **(2)** evaluating memories and actively highlighting “more valuable” ones, **(3)** recording in a journal as a way to process thoughts and emotions, **(4)** drawing insights and making goals pertaining to social experiences from recordings, **(5)** regular intervals of recording everyday life in a journal, and **(6)** sharing past memories and accompanying thoughts with friends. After exploring various ideas involving physical journals, integrating social platforms into a daily entries, and bridging the digital and physical realms of journaling, we decided to focus on two primary tasks: regular recording of everyday life and evaluating memories to record those that are most meaningful. This led to the design of a mobile app to easily collect digital memories that already exist and allow the seamless incorporation of content from the physical world.


### Initial Paper Prototype
Our initial paper prototype worked to address four components of our main two tasks: easy daily recording and evaluating memories to keep those that are most meaningful. First, people who use our app would need to create a profile and connect services that their content can come from. Next, they could use these services to choose elements best able to represent their day. Thirdly, they could incorporate any physical journal entries that they want to be able to easily look back on into their digital interface. Finally, they could navigate through old entries and search for specific memories. Connecting services and using these to add content to a day helps one achieve easy recording of memories, while selectively including elements of a diary and looking back on memories through search and calendar view address evaluating memories for reminiscing. Below are the screens depicting each of the four components described above which help people accomplish the two selected tasks.

</p>


### Testing Process

We started testing with an evaluation based on Nielsen’s heuristics to get feedback on the overall practicality and ease of use of the approach of our app. From this, we proceeded with a series of refinements on our design and usability tests to gather empirical data on how people interact with our design.

Our heuristic evaluation was conducted in class with another HCI student as the participant. Then, our usability testing involved three college-aged males: two were respondents to our initial survey about journaling and one was another HCI student.

In our initial usability test, we presented our participant with our design and prompted them to do a series of specific tasks. In the test, Lucia was the observer taking written notes, Patrick was the computer, Mitchell was the facilitator, and Dana the observer taking pictures and videos (with the permission of the participant). When appropriate, everyone prompted the participant with any clarifying questions they had.

At the beginning of the test, Dana explained the main idea of our project and what we would be asking him to do. She also asked if he was okay with us taking videos and photos. Then, we asked him to complete the following tasks:

1. Create a new account
2. Add a new entry from an existing physical journal
3. Look back on a specific day
4. Search for memories related to “skiing”
5. Look at the stats for physical-journal memories
6. Unlink applications from his account

In performing the tasks, we requested that the participant share his thought process. After he completed the tasks, we asked if he had any input on the design and if there were any tasks he found particularly confusing or unintuitive.

In hindsight, the focus of this first usability test gravitated heavily towards the basic functionality of the app, such as whether the buttons made intuitive sense, which may have been influenced by the heuristic evaluation mindset. Additionally, we felt that we provided a little too much context and guidance in the first usability test, which made it easy for the participant due to artificial subgoals and, in some situations, pre-given answers. Hence, we refined our process to focus more on testing for the two primary tasks, looking out for how well our prototype allowed participants to accomplish them. To account for the realizations about over-guidance, we decided to coach less, and when explaining tasks we made sure our language did not align with any labels on the screen, making the necessary adjustments in order to avoid accidental guiding.  

### Testing Results and Prototype Refinement

Through our usability research we identified several issues surrounding our paper prototype. A majority of the issues centered around 3 themes. The first was icon clarity: assuring that the visual aspect of our icons clearly conveyed its action. The second was minimalistic design: advocating for a more simplistic application and removing clutter. And the last was consistency in screens: making sure all symbols and designs were uniform throughout screens.

The in-class heuristic evaluation mainly helped us in identifying consistency errors throughout our application (button/screen names, locations of navigation, etc.). Thus, before conducting our usability test, most of these issues were fixed. As stated, this addressed the theme of consistency in screens.

In our first usability test, we noticed that the participant was unclear on how to select/deselect parts of a physical journal entry. This issue was mainly an icon clarity problem but also pertained to minimalistic design. Because of this, we simplified the screen and used clearer action words to indicate the use of each button. Although not pictured, the after screen would portray a greyed out image of the journal entry. When the user would select the phrases he/she wanted, they would no longer be greyed out.

The screen shows highlighted and struck out text, and three buttons labeled: Select, Erase, and Strike, on the bottom of the screen."></p>
After: <p><img src="select_after_1.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A revised version of the screen that simplified the buttons from select, erase and strike, to just select and deselect. We found the inclusion of strike could be confusing to users, on how it is different from erase. We also added select all/deselect all buttons as well as undo and redo for greater control and ease of use."><img src="select_after_2.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A mockup to more clearly show the flow of how it would be used. An example photo of a physical journal entry is shown in the frame, but it is noticeably lightened/greyed out."><img src="select_after_3.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Shows the next step in the flow, with an outline of a user's hand, finger extended dragging over a sentence in the photo.

In our first and second usability test we discovered that participants were not sure about the difference between uploading from a physical journal and taking a photo. To make this clear, we made the icons and their captions connect more with the physical actions. In all, this was an icon clarity issue.

Before: <p><img src="scan_journal_before.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A drawing of our inital paper prototype screen depicting the add content options after the add content button is pressed on the day view. During our testing we found that participants were confused by the 'Take a photo' button, which they were supposed to press to upload photos of their physical journal entries."></p>
After: <p><img src="scan_journal_after.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A drawing of our revised screen to clear up the confusion from our initial prototype. There is now a new icon with a journal and a phone over it labeled 'Take a scanned photo of a journal', as well as the original icon of the camera now labeled 'Take a normal photo'. There are also the same counterparts for selected a photo from the phone's photo gallery."></p>

Lastly, we discovered two main issues in our third usability test. The first was that the participant wished to return to the onboarding tutorial. This issue did not pertain to any of the themes, but we felt that it was important to include. Originally, these screens were only visible when the user signed-up. We subsequently added an option in the settings menu that would allow for this functionality. This is shown on the right-most screen where it says “review onboarding screens”.

Before: <p><img src="settings_before.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A drawing of our inital paper prototype screen depicting the settings page."></p>
After: <p><img src="settings_after.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A drawing of our revised paper prototype depicting the settings page. Notice the new inclusion of a button to review the onboarding screens."></p>

Secondly, we found that the participant had difficulty knowing how to delete part of an entry. As part of our initial paper prototype, we had a swipe left functionality for delete. This was a minimalistic design issue. At first we wanted to create a very simple design but it was not intuitive for the participants. Because of this, we decided to incorporate an edit mode that would have a garbage icon to delete entries. We felt that this would be visually clear and more readily understood.

Before: <p><img src="delete_before.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A drawing of our inital paper prototype screen showing the action of deleting an item from the day view. The user has swiped left on an entry to reveal a delete and share icon for that item."></p>
After: <p><img src="delete_after.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A drawing of our revised paper prototype screen showing the new edit mode view, where a user is able to see the delete buttons clearly for each entry, without needing any hidden gestures, as well as undo and redo buttons of the bottom bar for more control."></p>

Overarching feedback from design critiques helped us address some of the layout, cluttering, and visual concerns associated with our design and further improve the prototype.

### Final Paper Prototype:

After our testing, we were able spot inconsistencies between screens and add functionality that helped users better accomplish the two tasks. Some critical aspects of the initial prototype include lack of clarity of some buttons and processes, such as adding scanned journal entries.

We refined how users accomplish the task of daily recording by adding a suggestions button, which would provide the option to auto-populate the day with entries drawn from different connected sources. Users can easily tap or drag those elements into their day, which saves them time. This contributes to the first task because one of the major pain points deterring people from journaling was how time consuming it is, so this suggestion feature aims to make recording more efficient.

</p>

We also refined how users accomplish the task of evaluating and selecting memories they want to keep. Initially, we only had a way to add and share content, but did not have a way to delete added entries. We realized that people may at times like to go back to an old day and want to delete their past entries, or potentially undo an entry accidentally just added. This not only supports Nielsen’s heuristic of “Control and Freedom” but also our task because it allows users to remove unwanted memories or moments of regret.

### Digital Mockup:

In our digital mockup, we focused on the same two tasks as our paper prototype: regular recording of everyday life and evaluation of memories to actively highlight more valuable ones. We divided the mockup into several different views: onboarding, home and settings, adding content, deleting content, sharing content, calendar, search, and statistics. We address the tasks in each of these views.

In transitioning from our paper prototype to our digital mockup we had to make considerations about fonts and textures. We wanted to maintain the simplicity of our app, but use shadows to add a degree of texture and convey that certain elements are buttons. We also needed to make some changes regarding which menus and navigation were shown on each screen to abide by our theme of minimalistic design.

In the onboarding screens, we mainly focused on the first task. We felt that making onboarding fast and easy would make users more likely to record regularly. Additionally, we gave the option of linking different accounts so that a user can easily capture different parts of his/her life.

</p>

In the home screen, we addressed task 1 by making it easy to interact with the app and begin recording memories.

</p>

Adding content addressed the first task. It clarified how to record your day. This was accomplished through the simple “+” icon to add content.

<p>
<img src="digital_day_1" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Screen showing 'Your Story'/'Today' without content added yet, but with ability to change the date, and to add/delete/share content. ">
<img src="digital_day_2" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Screen showing expanded add content options with services and suggestions">
<img src="digital_day_4" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Screen in 'add content' mode with an added memory to the day's story ">
<img src="digital_day_3" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Screen showing day's story after content was added, with option to add/delete/share">
</p>

Delete and share content directly accomplishes task two. It allows a user to pick and choose what he/she wants to remember. For example, if a particular part of the day was not enjoyable, they could choose to delete that memory. This works vice-versa with a positive memory and sharing.

#### Delete Content

<p>

<img src="digital_delete_5.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Updated 'Your story' page after">
</p>

#### Share Content

<p>
<img src="digital_share_1.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="'Your story' screen before share functionality has been used, with options to add/delete/share ">

<img src="digital_share_4.jpg" width="23%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="'Your story' screen demonstrating the sharing functionality, with certain memories selected with green checks ">
</p>

Calendar, search, and statistics addresses both tasks. For the first task (regular recording), it provides a day, week, and month view for the user. We felt that this would aid regular recording because a user could see when and how often he/she has been recording. Secondly, the search and the statistics views allow a user to filter through memories. This provides a platform for a user to “evaluate memories and actively highlight more valuable ones.”

</p>
